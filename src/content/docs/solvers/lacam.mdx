**LaCAM (Lazy CBS based on PIBT)** is a hybrid algorithm that bridges the gap between the optimal but slow CBS, and the fast but suboptimal PIBT.

## Motivation
While CBS guarantees optimal paths, its runtime scales exponentially with the number of agents and conflicts. For massive swarms (1,000+ agents), CBS often times out. PIBT is extremely fast but makes no guarantees about solution quality or livelocks.

LaCAM uses PIBT as a fast heuristic search within a CBS-like high-level tree.

## Algorithm Flow
1. Generates a high-level configuration.
2. Uses a variant of PIBT to quickly simulate if the configuration leads to the goal without conflicts.
3. Because PIBT is fast, LaCAM can search significantly more configurations per second than standard CBS.
4. "Lazy" constraints are only generated when PIBT fails to resolve a dense local conflict.

In Stasis AI, LaCAM allows us to push simulations above 1,000 concurrent agents while maintaining near-optimal pathing topologies.
