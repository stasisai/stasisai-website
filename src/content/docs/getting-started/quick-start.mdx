description: Running the MAFIS simulator locally.
---

Follow these steps to build and run the MAFIS simulator locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Rust & Cargo** (Latest stable toolchain)
- Any native dependencies required by **Bevy** (e.g., Alsa, udev, Wayland on Linux; typically bundled on Windows/macOS).

## 1. Clone the Simulator Repository

Clone the project from GitHub and navigate into the root directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stasisai/mafis.git
cd mafis
```

*(Note: Replace with your exact repository URL if different).*

## 2. Compile and Run the Engine

Because MAFIS is built natively in Rust and uses Bevy Engine, you do not need node modules or WebAssembly compilers. Simply use standard cargo commands.

To test the default simulation scene:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

Using `--release` is highly recommended for any performance measurements or high-density agent counts, as the Rust compiler optimizations dramatically reduce pathfinding calculation times.

## 3. Passing Configuration Parameters

You can pass arguments to control map loading, algorithms, or fault injection. Check the help command out of the box:

```bash
cargo run --release -- --help
```
