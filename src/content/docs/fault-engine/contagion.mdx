title: Contagion Logic & Waves
description: How the Stasis AI engine propagates simulated chaos.

In complex cyber-physical systems, hardware failures rarely happen in isolated vacuums. A power surge, a localized network jamming array, or a physical hazard (like a chemical spill) often affects a geographic zone.

## The Ring Wave Model
To simulate this in Stasis AI, we implemented a **Ring Wave Contagion Protocol**.

1. **Epicenter Initiation**: The user clicks on the grid, defining an Absolute Origin point `(X, Y)`.
2. **Radial Expansion**: The internal engine uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) expansion radiating outward at a fixed `WAVE_SPEED`.
3. **Agent Trapping**: If the expanding wave intersects with a physical cell containing an active agent, the agent is immediately subjected to the prevailing Fault Model (e.g., Crash).
4. **Interpolation Freeze**: In the frontend, if an agent is caught mid-movement between two cells, the React Three Fiber engine calculates its precise `(x, z)` floating-point position via spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) and freezes it exactly on the boundary, offering a perfectly accurate visual representation of sudden death.

## API Triggers
You can trigger these waves programmatically using the web API console or via mouse interaction in the Simulator view.
