title: Metrics & Profiling
description: How to profile performance and export data from Stasis AI.
---

When executing chaos engineering on MAPF solvers, qualitative observation is good, but quantitative logic is required for publishable research. Stasis AI natively exposes a rich metrics pipeline.

## Frontend Profiling
The web interface ships with `r3f-perf`, a performance profiler that automatically measures:
- **GPU Frame Time (ms)**
- **CPU Script Time (ms)**
- **Draw Calls**
- **Polygons rendered**

This enables scientists to ensure that any stutter in the simulation is a result of algorithmic congestion, not rendering latency.

## Wasm Metrics API
The compiled WebAssembly module continuously logs data arrays formatted for JSON serialization.

At every tick, we expose:
1. **Throughput**: Total number of agents that successfully advanced.
2. **Pathfinding Latency**: Time (in microseconds) the Rust CPU took to solve the current step.
3. **Makespan**: The number of timesteps elapsed since epoch.
4. **Deadlocks**: The number of priority-inversion cycles active on the board.

These arrays can be batched and downloaded directly from the web client for posterior analysis using Python Dataframes (Pandas/Matplotlib).
