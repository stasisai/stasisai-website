Follow these steps to build and run the Stasis AI website and simulator locally.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Rust & Cargo** (Latest stable toolchain)
- **wasm-pack** (For compiling Rust into WebAssembly)

## 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project from GitHub and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stasisai/stasisai-website.git
cd stasisai-website
```

## 2. Compile the WebAssembly Module

Before running the website, the Rust engine must be compiled into a Wasm package.
Navigate to the rust crate directory (if separated) and run:

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```
*(Make sure the generated `pkg` folder is accessible by the web frontend).*

## 3. Install NPM Dependencies

Return to the root of the web project and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 4. Start the Dev Server

Launch the Astro development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:4322` to see the landing page and navigate to the `/simulator` to test the engine.
