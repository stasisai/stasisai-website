description: Understanding the crash and failure modes in Stasis AI.

Stasis AI goes beyond standard Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) by allowing real-time injection of chaotic elements.

## 1. Crash Faults
A Crash Fault simulates an agent suffering a hard failure—a motor blows out, the OS panics, or the battery dies instantly.
- **Behavior**: The agent freezes violently at its current topological position.
- **Impact**: The agent becomes a permanent, unmovable obstacle. Surrounding agents must immediately recalculate their routes.

## 2. Delay Faults (Latency Simulation)
A Delay Fault models network jitter, sensor lag, or computational throttling.
- **Behavior**: The agent continues to function but ignores tick updates for a randomized number of frames.
- **Impact**: It acts as a temporary roadblock, forcing follower agents to brake and form queues, creating compression waves in dense traffic lanes.

## 3. Byzantine / Routing Faults (Experimental)
A routing fault simulates a corrupted state where an agent receives or transmits incorrect topological coordinates.
- **Behavior**: The agent ignores its optimal path and moves erratically or aggressively blocks other high-priority agents.
- **Impact**: Forces the PIBT/LaCAM engines to continuously re-allocate priorities, stressing the algorithm's deadlock-resolution mechanisms.
